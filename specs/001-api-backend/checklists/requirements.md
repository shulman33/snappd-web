# Specification Quality Checklist: Core API Backend

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - ✅ Spec focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW. User scenarios describe outcomes, not code
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - ✅ All user stories tied to business value (core product, revenue model, retention)
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - ✅ Language avoids technical jargon; scenarios describe user actions and outcomes
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - ✅ User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, and Assumptions all present and filled

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - ✅ All requirements specified with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - ✅ All 25 functional requirements include specific, measurable criteria (file sizes, time limits, counts)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - ✅ All 12 success criteria include specific metrics (seconds, percentages, counts)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - ✅ Criteria describe user-facing outcomes without mentioning specific technologies
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - ✅ Each user story includes 3-5 concrete acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - ✅ 7 edge cases documented covering security, concurrency, expiration, webhooks, and errors
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - ✅ Three prioritized user stories (P1: upload/share, P2: auth/billing, P3: management) with independent test criteria
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - ✅ 10 assumptions documented covering auth, storage, billing, rate limiting, and search

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - ✅ Requirements specify exact limits (10MB, 200ms, 50 items/page, 10 uploads/min, $9/month)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - ✅ Three user stories cover complete product lifecycle: capture→share→manage→monetize
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - ✅ Success criteria align with product principles (10-second workflow, sub-200ms responses, 99.9% uptime)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - ✅ Spec describes user experiences and business rules without prescribing technical solutions

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Specification is complete and ready for planning phase

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive coverage of core product workflows
- Clear prioritization enables MVP-first approach (P1 only)
- Measurable success criteria aligned with constitution speed principles
- Well-defined edge cases and assumptions reduce ambiguity
- All requirements include specific, testable criteria

**Notes**:
- No clarifications needed - all decisions made with reasonable defaults
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` command for technical implementation planning
- Assumptions section provides clear foundation for architectural decisions
